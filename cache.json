Located on a sunny, spacious lot, the yard has been transformed into a pollinator's paradise with plants and flowers thoughtfully planted to create and support native birds and wildlife. Nods to the original cottage can be seen throughout the home, from the exposed brick to the custom-built bench and coat rack reclaimed from a barn on the property. Cathedral ceilings in the kitchen and primary bedroom allow for an abundance of natural light, creating a warm and inviting home away from the home. The eat-in kitchen is well-stocked for preparing meals and offers deck access so you can step outside to dine al fresco or plan the next day's adventures around the fire pit.Up for a little friendly competition? A game of cornhole may be just the thing on those warm evenings. Easy, one-level living includes a living room with a natural stone gas fireplace and a den (pocket doors for privacy) with a desk and queen-size sleeper sofa. The primary bedroom offers a queen-size bed and en suite bathroom with a spacious walk-in shower and full-size stackable washer and dryer, and there is another bedroom that offers a queen-size bed. Take in the gorgeous views of the surrounding Seven Sisters mountain range as you walk the elliptical trail at nearby Lake Tomahawk Park, where you can also enjoy an energetic tennis match, a summer swim at the Black Mountain Pool, and catch-and-release fishing (NC fishing license required). Known as the “Front Porch of Western North Carolina,” you’ll spot the iconic red rocking chairs throughout the treasured small town of Black Mountain that stand as your reminder to slow down, pull up a chair, and relax. Like the setting of your favorite novel, Black Mountain is an idyllic mountain town brimming with history and charm. Explore the timeless Town Hardware & General Store that offers so much more than housewares and tools, the quaint Sassafrass (on Sutton & Main) filled with spellbinding books and delightful toys, and the inspiring Seven Sisters Gallery and The Red House Studios & Gallery that sell handcrafted pieces and artwork by local artisans. Make sure you stop along the way for a bite to eat at one of Black Mountain's gourmet restaurants or cafes. From authentic Cuban cuisine to fresh vegetarian fare to culinary twists on southern staples, your taste buds will never get bored here.
