All of the thoughtful touches made our stay especially comfortable and enjoyable. This is, by far, the best Airbnb stay we have enjoyed in the US.”10 stars! - “This is one of our favorite places to stay while in Fort Collins. This is perfect for 2 couples, or a family. The rooftop deck is great to enjoy morning coffee or evening wine. There's also a patio off the kitchen that is convenient for BBQing.

The property was just what we expected as the pictures truly represented it. Amazing location, light-filled space.

You could definitely be fine without a car but the parking spot was the best addition. So much to do and right down the street from New Belgium.” – Kevin, March 2024“Great food, walks, bike rides, short drives - all within easy distance. The accommodation is pristine. Everything you need is there but nothing extraneous. We are hoping to return every summer from our over-heated life in Arizona.

A formal living room opens to the dining room, kitchen, open-air deck, and screened-in porch with lounge chairs.

The main level of the home also offers a laundry room with a washer & dryer and a primary bedroom with a king-size bed and an en suite bathroom with an oversized soaking tub, walk-in shower, and double vanity. Interested in star gazing?

For additional entertaining space, the lower level of the home boasts a second living room with a sleeper sofa, television for streaming, gas logs fireplace, and access to the covered deck with a gas grill and an 8-person hot tub. Also on the lower level are two bedrooms, each with a queen-sized bed and en suite bathroom.Fireside Retreat is located within the beautiful gated community of Catawba Falls Preserve where wildlife is abundant and sightings can be frequent and very exciting. There are multiple hiking trails in this exquisite community, and the roads are paved and easily navigated. A favorite hike in the community is Catawba Falls (two trail options to Upper or Lower Falls). Perfect for the whole family, the Lower Catawba Falls is a 2.5-mile round-trip trek that takes you to a 100' cascading waterfall with multiple tiers of water rushing over vibrant green moss. The steep trail that continues up the right side of the waterfall eventually levels out and is less than 1/4 mile to Upper Catawba Falls. Whether you stay at the lower falls or brave the upper falls, both are breathtaking sights that are a must for waterfall enthusiasts! Take a quick 20-minute drive to reach downtown Black Mountain.

After experiencing all that Black Mountain has to offer, take time to explore the “Land of Sky,” Asheville just 35 minutes away. While there, check out the hip and artsy West Asheville district, North Carolina Arboretum, and iconic Biltmore Estate, and sample the award-winning restaurants and breweries between all your activities. Take a 35-minute drive south to reach Lake Lure and the Village of Chimney Rock and its corresponding Chimney Rock State Park. Spend your days hiking on the various trails within the state park, browsing the adorable shops, strolling atop the quirky and colorful Lake Lure Flowering Bridge, or soaking up the sun, swimming, and canoeing on Lake Lure’s Mountain Beach & Waterpark. Grab lunch at Lake House Restaurant Bar & Grill, La Strada, or Point of View before having a cold beer at Hickory Nut Gorge Brewery or a glass of locally-curated wine at Burntshirt Vineyards. Please note: This home is pet-friendly with an additional fee. No parking is allowed on roadways, at gate entrances, or in non-paved areas in the Catawba Falls Community.

Whether you're visiting on a family vacation, a getaway with close friends, or a couple's retreat, you'll find pastoral charm & modern luxury at this architectural gem.In the morning, enjoy your coffee on the covered back patio while listening to the tranquil sounds of the waterfall feature in the backyard that lends the cabin its name. After coffee, stroll or bike through the 16 private acres of forest at the property to breathe in the fresh mountain air. When you return, carve out time to work on creative projects at the desk in the bedroom before sitting down to a delicious breakfast at the kitchen bar that includes blueberries from the garden when in season.After breakfast, make your way to the local stables at Saddle-Up Trail Rides to go on a scenic riding tour through the Pisgah National Forest, or take a 15-minute drive into Hendersonville to play an exciting round of paintball at Wolverine Paintball Park. If you're interested in chasing epic waterfalls travel just 20 min. to the DuPont State Forest. The most well-known among the 3 is the High Falls Loop trail, a 2.2-mile trek that was once the filming location for the first Hunger Games movie & is an absolute must for outdoor and film enthusiasts alike. Beautiful during any season, the spring & summer months provide the perfect weather for rock hopping along the river bank, while the fall & winter months provide natural marvels like color-changing foliage and spectacular ice formations. In the afternoon, cheers to your adventures at a local brewery over some ice-cold brews. At Mills River Brewing Co., listen to live music while soaking up the sun on their outdoor patio & sipping their refreshing Riverside Hefe.Less than 15 minutes away, you'll find Sideways Farm & Brewery, where you can enjoy a unique artisan farm ale that is bottled & naturally conditioned with local wildflower honey. Blue Ghost Brewing, located less than 5 minutes from the airport, is named after the Blue Ghost Firefly—a native species unique to the southern Appalachian Mountains. Enjoy their LAGA Golden Ale or their Grapefruit IPA year round along with a stadium pretzel or tray of fried brussel sprouts at their Hungry Ghost food truck. End your tour with two of the most well-known breweries in the area—Bold Rock Mills River Cidery & the iconic Sierra Nevada Brewing Company & Taproom.

While 4WD/AWD is not required, we strongly recommend vehicles with high clearance since the road is gravel. Gas logs are only operable September-May & are shut off during the summer months of June, July, and August. The backyard water feature is not operational December-April or when cooler temperatures are expected. The WIFI connection is from a satellite internet provider so it's limited and can be impacted by the weather and growing season. Be sure to check out the virtual walkthrough & area guide video in the top left corner of the slideshow!",

Nestled in a grove of rhododendrons and mountain laurel, this home has the feeling of seclusion while only being a few minutes from town. A large deck offers winter views of the Blue Ridge Mountains, if the weather is nice, dine alfresco as you take in the beauty of the mountains. As the sun dips behind the mountains, curl up in front of the wood-burning stove, available for use in the winter months, and put your favorite movie on the Smart TV (streaming & Youtube).During the day, the many windows in the cathedral-ceilinged great room and the white walls make the space airy and bright. The kitchen is cozy and well-equipped with a Dutch oven, food processor, and all the basics you need to craft the meals you love. The main floor has the dining room, a living room with two twin sleeper chairs, a kitchen, a bedroom with a King bed, and a full hall bath. Upstairs has an additional bedroom with a king bed and a full hall bath, along with a small outdoor balcony.Just minutes away from the charming downtown Black Mountain, it's easy to pop into one of our bakeries or coffee shops for a morning treat. Grab an orange roll and a chocolate croissant from Four Sisters Bakery - and pick up a loaf of rosemary and olive oil focaccia for dinner while you're there. Head back to the house with your spoils, or adventure into Montreat for a nice morning hike. Attempt Graybeard Mountain, a 5,550ft summit with a 9-mile round trip trail ending in stunning views of the Montreat valley to the south and Mount Mitchell to the north. Spend your evening browsing the lovely shops in downtown Black Mountain, stopping into Black Mountain Brewing for a taste of our local flavor and a nice dry stout or IPA.

Vivian creates honest American food with big flavors, that utilize the bountiful products of our region and the European heritage. The menu is ever-changing, but expect bold and delicious no matter what.

        "description": "Take a deep breath and relax in the lush comforts of Pinnacle View. From its perch near the top of Allen Mountain, this home offers the convenience of being 8 minutes away from downtown Black Mountain paired with sweeping views of the Valley. The moment you step out of your car and onto the river rock driveway, walk up the front steps with ivy creeping up the posts, and through the walnut door, you'll feel like you're within the pages of a fairytale.The open floor plan living space provides you with the perfect setting for your group. Enjoy a nice whiskey or crisp chardonnay as you gather in front of the gas fireplace. As your dinner of roasted potatoes and steak sizzles on the gas range or the gas grill, finish prepping your salad on the light granite countertops. A custom connoisseur dream with black cabinets and plenty of space to prepare, you may not want to dine anywhere else.However, if you're feeling in the mood for someone else to prepare your meal, grab some takeout from La Guinguette, a restaurant in Black Mountain specializing in savory crepes and enchiladas, and relish your time together. If you can pull yourself away from the view, venture out to explore the beauty and wonder of Western North Carolina. Hike the nearby trails in Montreat, the Lookout trail offers stunning views of the Swannanoa Valley, or head down the mountain to Catawba Falls to capture a lovely waterfall and natural pool. After a morning of exploring, head back home for a brief respite before going into Asheville for the evening.Roam the vibrant streets downtown, browsing the locally curated shops, and galleries. Dine at Strada Italiano or try to snag a table at their sister restaurant, The Social Lounge, and enjoy delicious Italian food and cocktails on a rooftop locale. Start with delectable Tuscan figs, move to their signature Grilled Florentine Ravioli or Porchetta, and finish with a classic cannoli. If you're up for more time in Asheville, wander over to one of the many breweries downtown and sample our claim to the Beer City name.House Layout:Main Level- Open floor plan with living room, dining area with a table that seats 6, and kitchen (island seats 2). A bedroom with a King bed and full bath. A bedroom with a Queen bed and full hall bathroom.Lower Level- Den with a wood-burning fireplace and Smart TV (YouTube TV with Netflix, Prime, Pluto, etc).

        "title": "Deer Field Cabin",
        "description": "This home is the perfect fit for those hoping to unplug for some R & R! While cell service and WIFI are available, internet connection is extremely limited, so you're able to truly disconnect and relax during your time in the mountains. The WIFI speed is 50/60 Mbps, and there is a Mesh WIFI booster that connects to the satellite. The WIFI is best for checking emails and surfing the web. Unfortunately, streaming movies and music and playing games is extremely limited, and service interruptions are likely.Located in \"Heart Ridge Cove\" in Burnsville/Mars Hill, the newly constructed Deer Field Cabin offers 100+ private acres with timber roads throughout and exceptional long-range mountain views from various parts of the cove that includes Mt Mitchell and Craggy Pinnacle Summit. Thoughtfully designed with two primary master bedrooms, a luxury log cabin experience awaits you.The main floor of the cabin boasts an open-concept kitchen and dining space with a custom-built ”local oak” island and access to a spacious covered deck with 4 log-style rocking chairs to watch the morning fog roll across the cove. A connected gas grill and outdoor fire pit provide opportunities for fellowship whether whipping up dinner or making s'mores. When you're ready to settle in for the evening, the upper level offers a twin-size bunk bed on the loft-style landing at the top of the stairs. Continue to find two primary suites, each with a king-size bed, and an en suite bathroom with a clawfoot soaking tub and walk-in shower.While private and peaceful, the home is conveniently located within a 13-minute drive of Mars Hill University and its Southern Appalachian Repertory Theater, and it’s within a 15-minute drive of area grocery stores and downtown Burnsville which offers local shops, dining options, and a lively art scene. Catch a play at the historic Parkway Playhouse (open April-December), or check out the renowned Penland School of Craft and its corresponding gallery. Also within a 15-minute drive of the home are the Stables at Bucktown. Located just inside the gatehouse of The Preserve at Wolf Laurel, they offer trail rides, riding lessons, and 30-minute rides in the arena for horse enthusiasts under the age of 7.Take a 20-minute drive to reach the charming small town of Weaverville, which is home to several notable restaurants like The Twisted Laurel and Stoney Knob Cafe, as well as the \"Best Small Town\" bakery, Well-Bred. There are also several breweries, green spaces, and festivals to enjoy throughout the year. For outdoor adventure, take a 25-minute drive to Navitat Canopy Adventures in Barnardsville to zipline atop the trees at sunset or under a blanket of stars, or take a 30-minute drive to reach Carolina Hemlocks Recreation Area (on the way to Mount Mitchell Park) which offers great outdoor swimming, tubing, and fishing opportunities. An hour’s drive South of Deer Field Cabin will bring you to the iconic Mt. Mitchell peak, aka the highest mountain east of the Mississippi River, and its corresponding State Park—the perfect destination for a daytime adventure! In addition to this famous trek, the Burnsville area is home to a few other great hiking spots. If you’re interested in chasing waterfalls, try the Roaring Fork Creek Falls, a 0.5-mile trail that leads to a stunning 100 ft. cascade and is suitable for all skill levels. If you’re seeking panoramic mountain views, try the moderate Blue Ridge Pinnacle & Rocky Knob trail that winds through a lush forest setting chock full of various regional wildflowers, mushrooms, and birds before bringing you to the pinnacle. Deer Field Cabin is also within a 15-minute drive from the newly branded Hatley Pointe Ski Resort (formerly Wolf Ridge Ski Resort). The ski resort also offers dining at its Smoke and Timber restaurant. Remember that no trip to the mountains of Western North Carolina is complete without experiencing the “Paris of the South,” Asheville, located just 30 minutes away. While there, be sure to check out the ever-eccentric River Arts District, North Carolina Arboretum, and America’s Largest Home ®, the Biltmore Estate. Asheville is also home to a large number of award-winning restaurants & breweries that you can sample between activities. Traveling with a larger group? An identical, newly constructed cabin, \"Cubs Den Cabin,\" is also available to book! \"Heart Ridge Cove\" is true to its name; not only is the property line shaped like a heart, set in a private cove, but it has been a project of the heart for the homeowners as they lovingly design a luxury guest experience. We hope you'll \"grow with us\" in Heart Ridge Cove!Please Note: This home is NOT pet-friendly. The property is secured by a private electronic gate, and there is an exterior security camera above the parking area.",
