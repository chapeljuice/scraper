The extended family enjoyed many adventures in the area, including hiking, river tubing, sightseeing, breweries, and shopping. At the end of the day, we were able to come back to a comfortable retreat that encouraged us to relax and spend time talking about our day while enjoying the beautiful natural environment the area is known for. We hope that our home will create some of those same memories for your family.\"Please Note: The road to Angie's is narrow and steep but paved.

From the vibrant color palette & abstract expressionist art that is unique to each space within the house to the eccentric light fixtures and high-quality craftsmanship, you'll instantly feel inspired by the innovative & impeccable styling of this inviting mountain oasis. In the morning, settle in the Adirondacks on the upper deck to watch the vivid sunrise while you sip your coffee and listen to the songs of native birds. On rainy days, listen for the tranquil rushing of nearby mountain streams, and on those occasional windy days, listen for the wind whistling through the rhododendrons.After coffee, wander along the property's walking trails that wind around the house and up the mountain before returning to enjoy breakfast at the kitchen bar. Thoughtfully supplied, take advantage of the waffle maker & Vitamix in the sleek gourmet kitchen to make a stack of waffles and a batch of fresh fruit smoothies for you & your group. Boasting a Dog Cubby with bowls, mats, treats & toys, your pup can enjoy its own special supplies in the kitchen while you do. After breakfast, carve out time to work on projects at the desk in the main living room or keep up with your workout routine in the small home gym behind the large cabinet doors in the lower-level hallway.Retro Metro Deck House is located just 20 min. from the quaint towns of Lake Lure & Chimney Rock & 15 min. from Asheville in the quiet community of Fairview dotted with picturesque farmland open to the public. Hickory Nut Gap Farm is best known for its meat supply to the finest farm-to-table restaurants in the AVL area & as a stop along the WNC Cheese Trail, but there are also seasonal events and festivals to enjoy. Another destination along the trail is Looking Glass Creamery. Stop by to sample their homemade cheese & Carmoolita caramel paired with a glass of wine. For more farm fun, visit the sustainable Flying Cloud Farm, where you can treat yourself to a vibrant U-pick bouquet of native flowers & a bushel of fresh berries.Once you've had your fill of country living, travel into the city to enjoy the shopping, attractions, and art scene that characterize the mountains of WNC. For area hiking, check out Bearwallow Mountain trail, an easy 1-mile hike that reaches a grassy meadow at its summit and features a nearly 360 view, including Mt. Mitchell and Mt. Pisgah. You'll love strolling through the wildflowers & picnicking alongside the grazing cattle that call this mountaintop home. After your hike, reward yourself with a cold beer from Whistlehop Brewing Co. that includes a family & pet-friendly playground with several activities (such as mini golf) to enjoy. After that, head over to Turgua Brewing, situated beside Cane Creek, to listen to live music and sip on their craft ciders, meads, or ales.In the evening, return home to read one of the books in the home's library before going inside to make dinner using the gas grill to be enjoyed at the live edge dining table with panoramic woodland views. After dinner, grab chilled mixers from the beverage fridge & use the tools on the bar cart to create a tasty cocktail to enjoy around one of the wood-burning fireplaces or the glowing blue fire pit on the deck. Linger outside to stargaze before returning inside to stream movies on one of the smart TVs or pop in one of the many DVDs. Stay up late to play some board games, card games, and video games on the WiiU console, or enjoy a low-key night of solving puzzles and sipping wine.Note: This home IS pet friendly with an additional fee. There is an exterior camera facing the driveway. While not required, 4WD/AWD is encouraged from December to March when icy and/or snowy road conditions are possible. A 6-person hot tub was added in 2021. This home offers a whole home generator that is also connected to the hot tub, so your vacation won't be interrupted in the unlikely event of a power outage. Visit https://www.stayatretrometro.com/ to learn more about the home and things to do in the area!",

        "description": "This home is the perfect fit for those hoping to unplug for some R & R! While cell service and WIFI are available, internet connection is extremely limited, so you're able to truly disconnect and relax during your time in the mountains. The WIFI speed is 50/60 Mbps, and there is a Mesh WIFI booster that connects to the satellite. The WIFI is best for checking emails and surfing the web. Unfortunately, streaming movies and music and playing games is extremely limited, and service interruptions are likely.Located in \"Heart Ridge Cove\" in Burnsville/Mars Hill, the newly constructed Deer Field Cabin offers 100+ private acres with timber roads throughout and exceptional long-range mountain views from various parts of the cove that includes Mt Mitchell and Craggy Pinnacle Summit. Thoughtfully designed with two primary master bedrooms, a luxury log cabin experience awaits you.The main floor of the cabin boasts an open-concept kitchen and dining space with a custom-built ”local oak” island and access to a spacious covered deck with 4 log-style rocking chairs to watch the morning fog roll across the cove. A connected gas grill and outdoor fire pit provide opportunities for fellowship whether whipping up dinner or making s'mores. When you're ready to settle in for the evening, the upper level offers a twin-size bunk bed on the loft-style landing at the top of the stairs. Continue to find two primary suites, each with a king-size bed, and an en suite bathroom with a clawfoot soaking tub and walk-in shower.While private and peaceful, the home is conveniently located within a 13-minute drive of Mars Hill University and its Southern Appalachian Repertory Theater, and it’s within a 15-minute drive of area grocery stores and downtown Burnsville which offers local shops, dining options, and a lively art scene. Catch a play at the historic Parkway Playhouse (open April-December), or check out the renowned Penland School of Craft and its corresponding gallery. Also within a 15-minute drive of the home are the Stables at Bucktown. Located just inside the gatehouse of The Preserve at Wolf Laurel, they offer trail rides, riding lessons, and 30-minute rides in the arena for horse enthusiasts under the age of 7.Take a 20-minute drive to reach the charming small town of Weaverville, which is home to several notable restaurants like The Twisted Laurel and Stoney Knob Cafe, as well as the \"Best Small Town\" bakery, Well-Bred. There are also several breweries, green spaces, and festivals to enjoy throughout the year. For outdoor adventure, take a 25-minute drive to Navitat Canopy Adventures in Barnardsville to zipline atop the trees at sunset or under a blanket of stars, or take a 30-minute drive to reach Carolina Hemlocks Recreation Area (on the way to Mount Mitchell Park) which offers great outdoor swimming, tubing, and fishing opportunities. An hour’s drive South of Deer Field Cabin will bring you to the iconic Mt. Mitchell peak, aka the highest mountain east of the Mississippi River, and its corresponding State Park—the perfect destination for a daytime adventure! In addition to this famous trek, the Burnsville area is home to a few other great hiking spots. If you’re interested in chasing waterfalls, try the Roaring Fork Creek Falls, a 0.5-mile trail that leads to a stunning 100 ft. cascade and is suitable for all skill levels. If you’re seeking panoramic mountain views, try the moderate Blue Ridge Pinnacle & Rocky Knob trail that winds through a lush forest setting chock full of various regional wildflowers, mushrooms, and birds before bringing you to the pinnacle. Deer Field Cabin is also within a 15-minute drive from the newly branded Hatley Pointe Ski Resort (formerly Wolf Ridge Ski Resort). The ski resort also offers dining at its Smoke and Timber restaurant. Remember that no trip to the mountains of Western North Carolina is complete without experiencing the “Paris of the South,” Asheville, located just 30 minutes away. While there, be sure to check out the ever-eccentric River Arts District, North Carolina Arboretum, and America’s Largest Home ®, the Biltmore Estate. Asheville is also home to a large number of award-winning restaurants & breweries that you can sample between activities. Traveling with a larger group? An identical, newly constructed cabin, \"Cubs Den Cabin,\" is also available to book! \"Heart Ridge Cove\" is true to its name; not only is the property line shaped like a heart, set in a private cove, but it has been a project of the heart for the homeowners as they lovingly design a luxury guest experience. We hope you'll \"grow with us\" in Heart Ridge Cove!Please Note: This home is NOT pet-friendly. The property is secured by a private electronic gate, and there is an exterior security camera above the parking area.",
